# Movie-Recommendation-System

Dears,
This project is written with python PL, it basically is a Movie Recommendation System that takes a different answers from the user using a survey then display the recommended film at the end and its poster.

The project.py file and other folders should be in the same file when downloading it.
The other files should be named exactly the same as I named them, "Soundtracks", "Images", "DataBase" (with the same capital letters).
For any further explanation please send me on

Thank you.
